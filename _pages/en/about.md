Hi! I am a recent physics/astrophysics Ph.D. graduate from McGill University. Throughout my degree, I worked on the modeling of thermonuclear bursts on accreting compact objects, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~cumming/">Prof. Andrew Cumming</a>. My research combines aspects of nuclear astrophysics, fluid dynamics and computational physics. Before this, I completed an engineering physics degree at Polytechnique Montr√©al.

I am currently looking for employment opportunities. I am interested in many different sectors involving research, mathematical and programatic modeling, and engineering. If you would like to discuss with me, please reach out via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonguichandut">LinkedIn</a>, or you can email me at <a href="mailto:simonguichandut@gmail.com">simonguichandut@gmail.com</a>.
